This project is an advanced Eye Tracker System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe,Machine Learning designed for real-time eye movement detection and tracking.
Features
High Accuracy: Achieved a 96% accuracy rate through precise calibration and machine learning integration.
Robust Performance: The system performs consistently in diverse environments, including different lighting conditions, by reducing sensitivity to positional changes.
Virtual Keyboard Application: Developed a virtual keyboard controlled by eye movements, offering hands-free typing functionality.
